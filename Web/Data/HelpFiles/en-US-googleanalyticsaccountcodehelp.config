<p>Visit <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">https://www.google.com/analytics/</a> to get your Google Analytics account. Once you've signed up with Google Analytics, copy and paste your Google Analytics account code into this box. mojoPortal will insert the necessary scripts into every page in your site, so you don't have to do it manually. Your account code will look something like G-xxxxxxxxx.
</p>
<p>Note:&nbsp;Using a "UA-" account code will use old UA scripts. Using, new "G-" code will use new Google Analytics 4 gtag.js scripts.
