/// Rationale: from my research most regular expression I have tried has some problem.
/// The best one so far has been @"^([0-9a-zA-Z](['-.\w]*[_0-9a-zA-Z])*@(([0-9a-zA-Z])+([-\w']*[0-9a-zA-Z])*\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,9})$";
/// this one seems to have a performance problem on server validation for some inputs, a known example input that hangs the registration 
/// page and spikes cpu usage is patriciarichards5395@yahoo.comgetgoing (which is technically a valid email address format even if it isn't a real email address)
/// others I tested did not have the performance problem but return invalid for emails like foo+test@foo.com which should be valid.
/// False negatives like that are a worse problem but performance issues are also a major problem because they could be used for denial of service
/// or attempts to overload the server.
/// So the goal of this control is to keep using the regular expression above (or you can override it by config) for client side validation,
/// but for server side validation skip the regex and just test if the provided string can be used in a mail address as seen below in SecurityHelper.IsValidEmailAddress(...)
/// this way we can avoid the server side hit for the regex evaluation
